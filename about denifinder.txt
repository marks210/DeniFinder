🚚 Advance Assist – Book Your Future Home Early
Advance Assist is a premium feature for people relocating or planning to rent soon.
👇 How It Works:
            1. The user pays a small fee to book DeniFinder’s help in advance

            2. They enter their preferred:

               * Location

               * Budget

               * Move-in date

               * Room type & preferences

                  3. DeniFinder's system monitors listings and alerts them before others when a match appears

                  4. A real person from our support team can also reach out with help

🎁 Bonus: They get early access to new listings and priority responses

💰 Monetization Strategy
                     1. Advance Assist Fee – One-time or subscription-based

                     2. Featured Listings – Landlords can pay to promote their listings

                     3. Verification Fees – For landlords who want a “Verified” badge

                     4. Ad Revenue – Optional future income from in-app ads (moving services, furniture, etc.)

                     5. Bulk Plans for Property Managers – Special pricing for hostels or estates with many units
